A version of the COSP code is included here in src/cosp_github

To check if the upstream COSP code at github.com/CFMIP/COSPv2.0 differs
from this version run check_cosp_github.sh and then see if there are any
differences by having a look at cosp_diff_to_github.out

IF YOU ARE REALLY SURE that you want to use the upstream version rather
than the version here, you can use copy_cosp_github.sh
to overwrite relevant files with their upstream versions.
